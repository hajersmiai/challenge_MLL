    "# Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Embedding?\n",
    "As we know, machines can't handle text, it can only handle numbers. But how to convert a word to numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most naive approach would be to take a list of all the words in your text and attribute a number to all of them. It will work but you can imagine that some problems will appear:\n",
    "* How do you handle unknown words? \n",
    "* If your text contains `doctor`, `nurse`, and `candy`. `doctor` and `nurse` have a strong similarity but `candy` doesn't. How can we make the machine understand that? With our naive technique, `doctor` could have the number `5` associated to it and nurse the number `98767`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a lot of people already spent some time with those problems. the solution that came out of it is \"Embedding\". \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding is a **VECTOR** which represents a word or a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector will be attributed to each token. Each vector will contain multiple dimensions (usually tens or hundreds of dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[...] associate with each word in the vocabulary a distributed word feature vector [...] The feature vector represents different aspects of the word: each word is associated with a point in a vector space. The number of features [...] is much smaller than the size of the vocabulary.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- [A Neural Probabilistic Language Model](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf), 2003.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short, embeddings convert words into vectors in a way that allows the machine to understand the similarity betweens them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each embedding library has it's own way of classifying words, it will regroup words into big categories. Each word will get a score for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take a simple example the word `mother` could be classified like that:\n",
    "\n",
    "|        | female | family | human | animal|\n",
    "|--------|--------|---------|-------|-------|\n",
    "| mother | 0.9    | 0.9.    | 0.7   | 0.1   |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanations:** Mother has a strong similarity with female, family and human but it has a low similarity with animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** Those numbers and categories are totally arbitrary and are only here to show an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another example with more complete datas:\n",
    "\n",
    "![embedding](https://miro.medium.com/max/2598/1*sAJdxEsDjsPMioHyzlN3_A.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Should I do it by hand?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could, but if some people already did the job for you and spent a lot of time to optimize it, why not use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of libraries out there for embeddings. Which one is the best? Once again, *it depends*. The results will change depending on the text you are using, the information you want to extract, the model you use,...\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the \"best\" embedding model will be part of the hyper-optimization that you can do at the end of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want understand embeddings more in depth, [follow this link](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/) or watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQddtTdmG_8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the best libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Gensim](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/)\n",
    "* [Word2Vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec)\n",
    "\n",
    "This next bit of code loads a model for practice. If you get an error, it may be due to the Python version (3.12.3 works), make sure you create a venv for that."
